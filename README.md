# TRM-identification
The tool can be used to identify transcriptional regulatory modules (TRMs) enriched within differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by recursively selecting a candidate transcription factor (TF) based on a predefined threshold. Given a set of target DMRs and background regions, it uses HOMERâ€™s known motif enrichment functionality to achieve the goal. If the number of DMRs is very large (> 50000), the user has the option to cluster the DMS into different subsets. Clustering is based on WGCNA (CWeighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis) algorithm. Other clustering algorithms such as K-means can also be used. On the other hand, if the number of DMRs is small, the user can directly apply recursive TRM identification on the entire set of DMRs.
